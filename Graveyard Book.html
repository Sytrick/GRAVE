        <p style="font-family:verdana; font-size:80%" ><i>“You're alive, Bod. That means you have infinite potential. You can do anything, make anything, dream anything. If you can change the world, the world will change. Potential. Once you're dead, it's gone. Over. You've made what you've made, dreamed your dream, written your name. You may be buried here, you may even walk. But that potential is finished.”
― Neil Gaiman, The Graveyard Book</p>
        <footer style="font-family:garamond; font-size:150%"><b>When I first read this part, it evoked great feelings in my heart. As someone who’s motivation comes mainly from my own ego, this quote instantly stuck out to me. It reminds me that I, too, am alive. My potential is infinite as long as I actually try to do it. And as he says, the moment I die is when I’m done doing stuff. Which is to say while I’m alive, I must continue walking my path otherwise when could I?

        <footer style="font-family:garamond; font-size:150%">This is Bod’s first time being left by Silas. He thought he would stay with him forever, but he did not. To be honest, I didn’t expect that coming. It happened so fast. I thought Silas will leave him after he becomes an adult. But if he didn’t leave, Bod wouldn't have been captured by the ghouls. I think that children have to be independent before they grow up.  - John<cite></footer>

        <footer style="font-family:garamond; font-size:150%">This quote is told by Silas in chapter three, I was deeply touched by this quote when I read Graveyard Book. Since Nobody stepped into the cemetery, he was destined to be the luckiest boy in the world. Although the Owens couple were not Bod’s biological parents, Bod still got the treatment like the real mom and dad.  - Rey<cite></footer>
